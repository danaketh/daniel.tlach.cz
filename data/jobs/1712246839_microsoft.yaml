  As a part of the Identity team I've been working on providing support to our customers with their Kusto clusters.
  I've started and participated on a project to improve access governance on Kusto clusters, which included changes
  like requiring periodical access renewal, or better organization and control over granted permissions. Currently
  I'm involved in a project which provides a high-level tooling for managing Kusto clusters.
