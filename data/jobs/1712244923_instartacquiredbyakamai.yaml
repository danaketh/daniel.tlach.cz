  Startup based in San Francisco, USA.

  I've built and maintained the company website. Built on top of WordPress, I've
  made a custom theme,

  plugins and blocks for Gutenberg. I've also modified the WordPress to use
  Symfony and Twig to render

  the public part of the website instead of leaving that to WP itself.
technologies:
  - Twig
  - SASS
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - WP Engine
  - MySQL
  - WordPress
  - PHP
