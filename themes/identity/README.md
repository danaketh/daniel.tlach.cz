# Identity theme for Hugo
Designed by Lukáš Moser for https://daniel.tlach.cz.

## Template notes
Instead of having partials for opening and closing `<html>`, `<body>`, `<main>`, etc. I'm opening these on every
page layout. It's a personal preference of avoiding having templates with broken HTML and also gives me more
control over the template.
