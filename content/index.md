# Hi, I’m Daniel, and I do stuff!

{{< intro >}}
Introverted software engineer with love for tea, cider, and LEGO. I’m also a big fan of Star Wars and Batman.
When I'm not coding, I'm either playing videogames or messing around with my family.

I've started programming in QBASIC in the 90s, moving to Turbo Pascal shortly after we've got internet connection
at home. In early 2000s I've started playing around with PHP, which has been my main occupation to this day. Recently
I've moved to [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to changes in my career path.

I have experience with several programming languages, with [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
and [Python](https://python.org) being my go-to languages for most of my career. I'm also familiar with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), several JavaScript frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/),
and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), different RDBMS, including [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and few other technologies like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or NoSQL.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) but if you're interested in
going over my career, you can find a full list of my work experience below.
